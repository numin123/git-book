# Chapter 2: Basic Git Commands for Project Management

## Initializing a New Repository (git init)
Create a new folder and run:
```
git init
```

**Example:**
You have a folder called `my-project`. Open it in the terminal and run `git init` to start tracking your project with Git.

## Checking Status (git status)
See the status of files in your repository:
```
git status
```

**Example:**
After editing a file, run `git status` to see which files have changed and are ready to be added.

## Adding Files to Staging Area (git add)
Add files you want to track:
```
git add <filename>
```

**Example:**
If you created a file called `report.txt`, run `git add report.txt` to stage it for commit.

## Committing Changes (git commit)
Save changes in the staging area:
```
git commit -m "commit message"
```

**Example:**
After staging your changes, run `git commit -m "Add report"` to save your work with a message.

## Viewing Commit History (git log)
See the commit history:
```
git log
```

**Example:**
Run `git log` to see a list of all previous commits and messages in your project.
