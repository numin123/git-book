# Chapter 1: Introduction to Git

## What is Git? (Introduction)
Git is a version control system that helps you track and manage changes to files in your project, such as code or documents. It allows you to go back to previous versions and collaborate with others easily.

**Example:**
You are writing a school report. With Git, you can save your progress at each step and return to any previous version if you make a mistake.

## Installing Git
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Install it following the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

**Example:**
If you use Windows, download the installer and follow the setup wizard. For Mac, you can use Homebrew: `brew install git`.

## Initial Configuration
After installing, set your name and email:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

**Example:**
If your name is Alice and your email is alice@example.com, run:
```
git config --global user.name "Alice"
git config --global user.email "alice@example.com"
```
